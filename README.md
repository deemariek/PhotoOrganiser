"# PhotoOrganiser" 

This is a python script that runs through various folders and iterates through each item in the folder and copies the item to an appropriate folder based on the item's year and month of capture. 

Currently the script requires the user to enter the folder locations in the script itself, but I'd hope to develop it to allow for command line usability. 

There are a number of other areas to work on mentioned at the beginning of the script.
